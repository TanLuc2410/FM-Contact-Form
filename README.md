## Overview

This is a **Responsive Contact Us** solution for the challenge on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). Built using **semantic HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**, the project emphasizes accessibility, responsive layout and custom form validation. It features interactive error messaging, keyboard-friendly navigation, and a visual success confirmation. This project was created to strengthen my front-end skills in accessible form design, client-side validation and mobile-first development.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- If I want to use validity object in JavaScript, I should set attribute `required` in the inputs that are necessary.

### Continued development

I still struggle and overwhelmed by a11y web designs. To fully tackle this problem, I need more experiences and more real-life projects where a11y standards are high.
